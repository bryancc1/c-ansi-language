Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most
likely to uncover bugs  if  there are any?

First bug:
      how do we know if 'a' is a letter or word?
      in english 'a' can be a word or a letter
      what is a word? well a word in our program is a characters sequence
      you got it,characters not character,also there are words like 'a'
      in this case is dependent of the programer take a one 'a' as a word
      or character
Tests:
      test a void input in the program
